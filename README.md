# EduJourney

EduJourney is a server-side application built with Node.js, SQL, and PostgreSQL that lays the foundation for a digital badge and certification tracking system in educational environments.

This backend system allows:

- Instructors/Admins to define badge and certification criteria based on course or module completion.

- Students to be awarded badges and certifications automatically as they progress through learning content.

- A relational database structure that tracks users, modules, badges, and certifications with clean, scalable queries and logic.

BadgeTrack is ideal for institutions and developers looking to implement digital recognition, gamify learning, or analyze student progress through a robust backend API and PostgreSQL-powered data model.
